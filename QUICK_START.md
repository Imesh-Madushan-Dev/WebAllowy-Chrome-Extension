## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start with Essential Sites**: Begin by adding only your most frequently used websites to the allowlist.

2. **Use Domain Names Only**: When adding sites, use just the domain name (e.g., `example.com`) without `http://`, `https://`, or paths.

3. **Temporary Access**: If you need temporary access to a site, consider temporarily disabling filtering rather than adding the site to your allowlist.

4. **Regular Backups**: Export your allowlist regularly to avoid losing your configuration.

5. **Testing Mode**: Before fully committing to using the extension, test it with a few sites to understand how it works.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension Not Blocking Sites**: Make sure filtering is enabled (toggle is ON).

- **Can't Access Allowed Sites**: Check that you've added the correct domain name to your allowlist.

- **Popup Not Opening**: Try reloading the extension from the extensions page.

- **Changes Not Saving**: Ensure your browser isn't in incognito/private mode, as some browsers limit storage in private browsing.
